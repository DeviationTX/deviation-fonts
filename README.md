# Upstream fonts for Deviation transmitters

This repo will contian fonts used to build the font-files used by Deviation

At the moment, this is just a repository of interesting fonts that have been or may be used in the future.  In the future configuration files will be included to automate the building of the relevant BDF files (which are then the base for the Deviation FON files)

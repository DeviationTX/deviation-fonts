# Manual overrides for building fonts

In some cases individual characters have been edited by Devaition developers to optimize the font appearance.  Those overrides are stored here such that fonts can be built as a combination of upstream/officially released characters and custom characters

* 12override.bdf: Various Extended-Latin and Cyrillic fixes for the 12px font
* 15override.bdf: Various Extended-Latin and Cyrillic fixes for the 15px font
* 23override.bdf: Increase size of '/' by one pixel for visbility
